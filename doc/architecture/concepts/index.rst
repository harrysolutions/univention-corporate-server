Univention Corporate Server (UCS) unites numerous concepts to support
administrators with their identity and infrastructure management tasks. Those
concepts are explained in this section.

The following concepts address identity management:

* :ref:`concept-domain`
* :ref:`concept-replication`
* :ref:`concept-role`
* :ref:`concept-permission`

The :ref:`certificate concept <concept-certificates>` explains how UCS handles
the certificate infrastructure in general and therefore relates to
infrastructure management.
