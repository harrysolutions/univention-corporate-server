 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Performing an Active Directory takeover will work when the original AD
   contains Group Policy Objects that use non ASCII encoding.
 * During AD domain takeover, samba-tool domain join was started with
   passing cleartext credentials as part of the command. Credentials are
   now passed via credentials file.
